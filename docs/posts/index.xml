      <description>Git and Github
Git and github are not the same, they are different things and are very useful if you are a developer, this useful tools are distributed version control tool that will help you to have your project safe, updated and if you are working in team this will help all the people in your team to collaborate and work very fast in the project.
Most of the open source projects are in github, so I&amp;rsquo;m 100% sure that the project that you are going to be part are going to be on github.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about the values, feelings, emotions and what I personally admire in a developer.
We don&amp;rsquo;t have to follow the stereotypes, I personally think that not all the developers are serious, gamers, apathic and something like that&amp;hellip; We all are people and we have feelings, I like to say that the developers are a box full of surprise and you need to know them because the will teach you something.</description>
