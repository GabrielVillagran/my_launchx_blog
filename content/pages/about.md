## Gabriel Aldair Villagr√°n Saucedo

Let me introduce myself ü§©

I'm from Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas and I'm studying my last year in **systems engineering at engineer faculty in Universidad Aut√≥noma de San Luis Potos√≠**, I like to study things related to cybersecurity, AI, computer networking  and on my free time I usually do some CTF challenges.

My hobbies are play guitar, bass, play videogames and go out with my friends and family.
