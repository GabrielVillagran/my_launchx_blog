**What is Unit Testing?**

Before I started to show you how to do this testing, let me talk about what is this and why is important to implement this tests to our projects.

Unit testing is a very useful technique that will help you to develop an application fully functional, **Important: If you see a project without testing, be careful, all the projects must have tests and this one should fail**.

Unit tests are developed using a framework or library where we will develop the tests that should fail and/or pass and we will develop the code for this test.

**How to develop our unit tests using Jest**

Jest is a framework for unit testing in JavaScript, this is a step-by-step guide to develop those tests:

1. Create a directory where your project will be contained, for example, **Ajolonauta**
2. Using your terminal go to the directory using cd, for example, **cd Ajolonauta**, once you are there use the next command, **npm init**
