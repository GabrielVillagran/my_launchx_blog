---

Hello ✌️  I'm glad that you're here, I'm  **Gabriel Aldair Villagrán Saucedo** In this blog, you will find all about my journey, learning about backend with the help of my Mission Commander (mentor), the one and only **Carlo Gilmar**.

On my github profile you can see some of the works that I have done across my learning path (courses, college, personal projects, etc...) feel free to use it if you want it.

I'm passionate about IT and cybersecurity but to be honest I love to learn new things :)
